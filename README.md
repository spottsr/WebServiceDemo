Sample code for consuming a webservice with C# and WPF framework in Visual Studio 2017.

## Background
I wrote this as a refresher assignment to myself and a starting point to a larger project.  It is a simple web service for converting temperatures between celcius, fahrenheit, kelvin, as well as a couple of other temperature scales.  The web service that provides the conversion is http://www.webservicex.net/ConvertTemperature.asmx?WSDL.
## Compiling
You must have Visual Studio 2017 or newer compile this code.  Simply on the WebServicesDemo.sln file and build the solution.
